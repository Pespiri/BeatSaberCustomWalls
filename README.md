### Contributing to CustomWalls
In order to build this project, please create the file `CustomWalls.csproj.user` and add your Beat Saber directory path to it in the project directory.
This file should not be uploaded to GitHub and is in the .gitignore.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Set "YOUR OWN" Beat Saber folder here to resolve most of the dependency paths! -->
    <BeatSaberDir>E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber</BeatSaberDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

If you plan on adding any new dependencies which are located in the Beat Saber directory, it would be nice if you edited the paths to use `$(BeatSaberDir)` in `CustomWalls.csproj`

```xml
...
<Reference Include="BS_Utils">
  <HintPath>$(BeatSaberDir)\Plugins\BS_Utils.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
<Reference Include="IPA.Loader">
  <HintPath>$(BeatSaberDir)\Beat Saber_Data\Managed\IPA.Loader.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
